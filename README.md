# ðŸ§  DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** practice repository! This repo contains solutions to a wide range of coding problems that Iâ€™ve practiced to improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.


The repository is organized by topic  for better readability and maintenance. Each folder contains problems related to a specific data structure, algorithm, or coding platform.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

You can browse through folders by topic or platform and run the code in your local environment. Most files include a brief description or problem statement.

## ðŸ™Œ Contributions

This is a personal practice repository, but feel free to fork and use it for your own learning. If you'd like to contribute or suggest improvements, feel free to open an issue or a pull request!
